## Welcome kittens!
Since you'd stumble upon my profile I ought to introduce myself 👋
Once upon a time, I was studying film studies at university. Then I grew up and discovered there is *surprisingly* not such a demand for film historians. Since then I have changed the cold, dark, and anonymous film hall to a cold and bright office. I have mixed together two things I loved when studying films – analyzing and writing about films – into my new job where I analyze and write about people.
I'm here to learn, always happy to meet new people 🌈

### 👩‍💻 I'm currently 
- working as a HR Analyst at [Kiwi.com](https://jobs.kiwi.com)
- reading books about data viz, statistics
